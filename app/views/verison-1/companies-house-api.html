      <p>The Companies House API and Developer Hub are currently at a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle">beta release</a>. We are going through a process of user engagement to improve the API and documentation.</p>
      <p>We have a proposed approach to versioning the API and documentation that is currently being
        <a href="http://forum.aws.chdev.org/t/versioning-the-companies-house-api/248">discussed in the Developer Hub Forum</a>. In the meantime existing resources will remain 'as is' and can be considered as at 'version 0'.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the
        <a href="http://forum.aws.chdev.org/">Developer Hub Forum</a>
        for ongoing feature and documentation discussions, and announcements on upcoming feature releases.</p>
